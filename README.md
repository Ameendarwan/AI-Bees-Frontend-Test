# AI-BEES Frontend Test

## Overview

This project is basically a task-based todo-list just like Trello and Jira. We can create task by adding fields like title, description, priority-level, and gifts. We can perform add, update, view, and delete (CRUD) operations in this todolist. Apart from that, we can move the task into done-list.

## Third party integrations

Different packages have been installed in order for the App to function properly.

- [Material-UI] - A UI kit which makes app responsive on different screen sizes.
- [Redux] - Responsible to manage the state of the app.
- [React-Toastify] - Improve the user experience by showing the response on events(CRUD) in the form of toast.

1. `npm i`
2. `npm start`
